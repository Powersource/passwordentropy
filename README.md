# passwordentropy
Calculate the entropy of your password with the help of compression
The idea is to be able to validate a humangenerated password against a dictionary-attack.
This is done by using a known passwordfile, appending your password to the end of the file, and compress both the file with your password and the original passwordfile. The amount of entropy your password has is the difference in filesize. This approximately the entropy if the given passwordlist is used in a dictionaryattack. Of course, this measurement is very dependent on the passwordlist, and usually the attackes has more information about the password for example that is has to be at least 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase, at least 1 specialcharacter, and things like that. Maybe the attacker has information about you as well, but if assumed that the password is not connected to yuo, this should be a lot better than the NISTstandard at least. The NIST standard gives "Password123" (4 + 2x7 + 3x1.5 + 6) = 28.5 bits of entropy, while my program achieves 8 bits of entropy with a small passwordlist, and Password123 wasn't even in there.
